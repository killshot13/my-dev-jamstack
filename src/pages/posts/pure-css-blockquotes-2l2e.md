## Overview

Developed using only CSS and HTML, these blockquotes examples offer a nice way to show off your site's accent color(s) without much extra work.

By using the natural breakpoints in the 
`border`
 and changing the 
`width`
 of the "negative space", I was able to create two nice angled versions.

## But How?

This is made possible by giving 
`border-bottom`
 and 
`border-top`
 the exact same color as 
`background-color`
, creating a simulated angle that would otherwise be hard to achieve on such a narrow width.

I'm sure I cannot be the only one to have thought of this idea, but I have not yet come across it so I am quite proud to take credit for this version of the concept at least. ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ
